After having intense years of hard work as Product Manager, I felt more and more the desire to share my experience, about cases or exercises I had to solve.

The purpose of this blog is to get half of my experience and half of insights or thoughts I encountered. I will try to get the posts accessible to any of you, experts in UX, management or others. 

Regarding my background, I will often tend to articles related to UX topics, Product management challenges encountered especially in start-ups contexts, and random discoveries I wanted to dig in. 

Thank you !

Ho, and yes, I'm currently looking for opportunities :) Feel free to get in [contact](https://www.myriamgoude.com/contact) with me :)
